## Development

In this household, we use [nix](nixos.org); If you're coding in VS Code, 
the [Nix Environment Selector Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arrterian.nix-env-selector)
should be able to pick up our `shell.nix`. For shell stuff, dropping into `nix-shell` and using normal cabal commands should
do the trick.
